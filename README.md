Empowers consumers to track, analyze, and optimize their online shopping expenses.

The widespread adoption of e-commerce and online shopping has revolutionized the retail industry, providing customers with convenience and accessibility. However, with the increasing popularity of online shopping, individuals face significant challenges in managing their expenses effectively. This problem statement aims to address the need for an efficient and user-friendly Online Shopping Expenses Management System (OSEMS) that empowers consumers to track, analyze, and optimize their online shopping expenses.


**a) Expense Categorization**: The absence of a standardized system for categorizing and organizing expenses often results in confusion, making it harder for consumers to evaluate their spending patterns and make informed financial decisions.

**b) Expense Analysis:** Without a dedicated platform for analyzing and visualizing expenses, users find it difficult to gain valuable insights into their online shopping habits. Lack of meaningful data representation makes it difficult for users from identifying trends, recognizing spending patterns, or implementing effective cost-saving measures.

**c) Budget Planning:** Planning and adhering to a budget can be a daunting task for online shoppers. The absence of a specialized tool to set and monitor budget limits hinders users from effectively managing their expenses, leading to financial stress, overspending, and potential debt accumulation.
